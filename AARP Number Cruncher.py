The March 2020 AARP magazine featured a simple sudoku type puzzle where a 3 by 3 grid is to filled 
in the digits 1,2,3,â€¦,9. Digits are to be used only once and need satisfy 
3 arithmetic row conditions and 3 arithmetic column conditions.

If the grid is represented by a 9-element array as follows:

x[0][0], x[0][1], x[0][2]
x[1][0], x[1][1], x[1][2]
x[2][0], x[2][1], x[2][2]

then the 6 conditions are

Rows
(x[0][0]+x[0][1])*x[0][2] == 24
x[1][0]+ x[1][1]+x[1][2] == 17
(x[2][0]-x[2][1])*x[2][2] == 27

Columns
(x[0][0]]+x[1][1][0])*x[2][0] == 44 
(x[0][1]*x[1][1])-x[2][1] == 20
(x[2]*x[5])+x[8] == 25 

this puzzle has the unique solution

5, 7, 2
6, 3, 8
4, 1, 9

The code below adapts a Backtrack Sudoku solver to solve the puzzle

******* A Disclaimer ********
Puzzles like this are often prescribed for the aging (me) to help maintain mental acuity. 
Personally, when I am able, I would rather code a program to solve a puzzle as opposed 
to actually solving it unless the puzzle is a crossword or like. The endless repetitive solving 
of word finds, sudoku, and similiar seem a bit pointless, though it could very well be they 
are more effective at preventing dementia than programming a solution.
