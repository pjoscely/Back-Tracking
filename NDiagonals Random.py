The link inspired the randomized solution below. Not the fastest, 
but nonetheless an amusing way to find solutions.

Returns a  list of possible moves for a cell with row = i and col = j 
based on the 8 neighbors of the cell
 0 ,  +1  ,   -1   represent empty cell ,  \  ,  /

The cells sharing an edge with a cell with a Â±1 cannot contain a âˆ“1.

If a cell contains a 1, the adjacent cells to the top-left 
and bottom-right cannot also contain a 1.

If a cell contains a -1, the adjacent cells to the bottom-left 
and top-right cannot also contain a -1.

Here, cells containing a "1" have a diagonal running top-left to bottom-right, 
and cells containing a "-1" have a diagonal running the other way.
 
Cells containing _ do not have a diagonal at all.
